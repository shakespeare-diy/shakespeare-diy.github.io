## 🎯 Missing Features for Full Git Client

### 1. **Branch Management UI** 🌿

**Missing Capabilities:**
- Visual branch tree/graph
- Branch comparison interface
- Protected branch rules
- Branch creation from specific commits
- Branch merging UI with conflict resolution
- Visual indication of tracking branches
- Upstream branch configuration
- Branch description/metadata

**Why It Matters:**
Users need to see the relationship between branches, understand which branch tracks which remote, and easily switch between branches without using shell commands.

---

### 2. **Merge & Conflict Resolution** 🔀

**Missing Capabilities:**
- Visual merge interface
- Three-way merge view
- Conflict resolution UI (ours vs theirs)
- Interactive merge conflict editor
- Merge strategy selection
- Merge preview (what will change)
- Automatic conflict detection
- Abort merge UI

**Why It Matters:**
Merge conflicts are inevitable in collaborative work. Without visual conflict resolution, users are blocked and must understand complex Git internals.

---

### 3. **Pull Request / Merge Request Workflow** 🔄

**Missing Capabilities:**
- Create pull request from local branch to upstream
- PR description and metadata
- Submit PR to GitHub/GitLab via API
- View open PRs
- Comment on PRs
- Review PR changes
- PR approval workflow
- Merge PR from UI
- PR status indicators
- Fork detection and PR targeting

**Why It Matters:**
PRs are the cornerstone of collaborative development. Without PR support, Shakespeare can't participate in modern Git workflows on platforms like GitHub/GitLab.

---

### 4. **Diff Visualization** 📊

**Missing Capabilities:**
- Side-by-side diff view
- Inline diff view
- Syntax-highlighted diffs
- Visual diff for images/binary files
- Diff between branches
- Diff between arbitrary commits
- Word-level diff highlighting
- Expandable context lines
- File tree with diff indicators

**Why It Matters:**
Understanding what changed is fundamental to code review and understanding project evolution. Current diff is text-only without visualization.

---

### 5. **Commit Management** 📝

**Missing Capabilities:**
- Amend last commit
- Interactive rebase UI
- Squash commits
- Cherry-pick commits
- Revert specific commits (not just rollback)
- Commit signing (GPG)
- Commit search/filter
- Blame view (git blame)
- Commit graph visualization
- Compare commits

**Why It Matters:**
Professional workflows require commit manipulation (squashing, amending, cherry-picking) before pushing. Current implementation only supports linear history.

---

### 6. **Remote Repository Browser** 🌐

**Missing Capabilities:**
- Browse remote branches
- View remote commit history
- Compare local vs remote
- Remote tag management
- Multiple remote management UI
- Fetch/pull specific remote branches
- Set tracking branches via UI
- Remote prune (remove stale remote refs)

**Why It Matters:**
Users need to understand what exists on remotes without pulling everything locally. Current implementation only shows local state.

---

### 7. **Git Submodules** 📦

**Missing Capabilities:**
- Add submodules
- Update submodules
- Initialize submodules
- Remove submodules
- Submodule status
- Recursive submodule operations
- Submodule branch tracking

**Why It Matters:**
Many projects use submodules for dependency management. Without support, these projects can't be fully managed in Shakespeare.

---

### 8. **Git LFS (Large File Storage)** 💾

**Missing Capabilities:**
- LFS initialization
- Track large files with LFS
- Pull LFS files
- Push LFS files
- LFS status/prune

**Why It Matters:**
Projects with large binary assets (images, videos, models) require LFS. Without it, repos with large files become unusable.

---

### 9. **Advanced History & Search** 🔍

**Missing Capabilities:**
- Commit search by message/author/date
- File history across renames
- Find commits that introduced/removed code
- Bisect to find bug-introducing commits

**Why It Matters:**
Hooks enable automation and policy enforcement (linting, testing, commit message format). Essential for professional workflows.

---

### 12. **Reflog & Recovery** ⚡

**Missing Capabilities:**
- View reflog (reference logs)
- Recover deleted branches
- Recover lost commits
- Reflog search
- Garbage collection awareness

**Why It Matters:**
Reflog is the safety net for Git. Without it, users can permanently lose work with no recovery option.

---

### 13. **Worktree Management** 🌳

**Missing Capabilities:**
- Create worktrees
- List worktrees
- Remove worktrees
- Switch between worktrees

**Why It Matters:**
Worktrees allow working on multiple branches simultaneously without stashing. Powerful for context switching.

---

### 14. **Patch Management** 📋

**Missing Capabilities:**
- Generate patches
- Apply patches
- Email patches
- Patch series management

**Why It Matters:**
Some projects still use email-based patch workflows (Linux kernel, Git itself). Required for contributing to these projects.

---

### 15. **Credential Management** 🔐

**Currently:**
- ✅ Basic credential storage in settings
- ✅ Credential lookup by URL
- ⚠️ Credentials stored in plain text in localStorage

**Missing:**
- Encrypted credential storage
- OAuth token refresh
- SSH key management
- Credential helpers
- Multi-account support per platform
- Credential expiry/renewal
- Security warnings for expired credentials

**Why It Matters:**
Security is paramount. Plain-text credentials are a major security risk. Professional credential management is essential.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Strategy

### Architecture Decisions:

1. **Existing Foundation:**
   - Continue using `isomorphic-git` for core Git operations
   - Maintain browser-based architecture (no backend required)
   - Use IndexedDB via LightningFS for storage
   - Keep TypeScript type safety throughout

2. **New Services Needed:**

   **GitHub/GitLab API Client:**
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/githubClient.ts
   class GitHubClient {
     async createPullRequest(options: CreatePROptions): Promise<PullRequest>
     async listPullRequests(repo: string): Promise<PullRequest[]>
     async mergePullRequest(pr: number): Promise<void>
     async addComment(pr: number, comment: string): Promise<void>
     // ... more PR operations
   }
   ```

   **Git Graph Generator:**
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/gitGraph.ts
   class GitGraph {
     async buildGraph(commits: GitCommit[]): Promise<GraphNode[]>
     async layoutBranches(): Promise<BranchLayout>
     // Visualization helpers
   }
   ```

   **Merge Conflict Resolver:**
   ```typescript
   // src/lib/mergeResolver.ts
   class MergeResolver {
     async detectConflicts(files: string[]): Promise<ConflictFile[]>
     async parseConflictMarkers(content: string): Promise<ConflictSection[]>
     async resolveConflict(file: string, resolution: Resolution): Promise<void>
   }
   ```

3. **State Management:**
   - Use TanStack Query for caching Git operations
   - Add optimistic updates for Git operations
   - Implement WebSocket for real-time collaboration (future)

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Lazy-load commit history (pagination)
   - Virtual scrolling for large diffs
   - Worker threads for diff computation
   - Incremental graph rendering
