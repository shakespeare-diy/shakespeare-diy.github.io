## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Feature Branch Workflow

1. **Create feature branch:**
   ```
   Advanced Git ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí New Branch
   Name: feature/add-login
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit** (via terminal or AI)

3. **Compare with main:**
   ```
   Advanced Git ‚Üí Compare
   Base: main
   Compare: feature/add-login
   ```

4. **Create pull request:**
   ```
   Advanced Git ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Pull Request
   Title: "Add login functionality"
   Description: "Implements user authentication..."
   ```

5. **After approval, merge:**
   ```
   Advanced Git ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Merge
   Source: feature/add-login
   ```

### Example 2: Reviewing Changes

1. **Check uncommitted changes:**
   ```
   Advanced Git ‚Üí Changes tab
   Review each file's diff
   ```

2. **Compare branches:**
   ```
   Advanced Git ‚Üí Compare
   See all differences before merging
   ```

3. **View specific commits:**
   ```
   Git Dialog ‚Üí History (existing feature)
   Click any commit to see details
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load branches"
**Cause:** Not a Git repository or Git error
**Solution:** Ensure the project has a `.git` directory. Try `git init` in terminal.

### "Failed to create pull request"
**Cause:** Missing credentials or API error
**Solution:** 
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Git
2. Add credentials for GitHub/GitLab
3. Ensure token has required permissions

### "Merge conflicts detected"
**Cause:** Conflicting changes in both branches
**Solution:**
1. Use terminal: `git merge <branch>`
2. Manually resolve conflicts in files
3. Stage resolved files: `git add <files>`
4. Complete merge: `git commit`

### "No remote configured"
**Cause:** No origin remote set
**Solution:**
1. Open Git Dialog
2. Enter remote URL
3. Click Save
