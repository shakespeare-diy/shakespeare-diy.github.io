## ⚙️ Behind the Scenes

### What Happens When You Switch?

1. **Validation:** Checks if branch exists
2. **Checkout:** Runs `git checkout <branch>`
3. **Status Update:** Refreshes Git status
4. **Rebuild:** Triggers project rebuild
5. **Notification:** Shows success toast

### What Happens When You Create?

1. **Name Validation:** Checks for invalid characters
2. **Duplicate Check:** Verifies branch doesn't exist
3. **Resolution:** Gets current HEAD commit
4. **Creation:** Runs `git branch <name> <commit>`
5. **Refresh:** Updates branch list
6. **Notification:** Shows success toast

**Note:** Creating a branch does NOT automatically switch to it. Use the dropdown to switch after creation if needed.
