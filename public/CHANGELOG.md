# Changelog

## [9.16.3] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Take back your sites one at a time — every name waiting for you now has its own Publish, Show, and Delete buttons, so you can keep the few you want and clear out the rest
- Show opens a site by its Nostr address before you decide about it, so you can look at names that never loaded in a browser

### Changed
- Deleting a name only gives it up on shakespeare.wtf — anything published to Nostr stays yours
- Names that couldn't be taken back safely can now be cleared out, instead of only explaining why they were stuck

## [9.16.2] - 2026-09-13

### Changed
- Deploy settings now says how many of your names are waiting to be taken back, and stays quiet when there are none

### Fixed
- Names you published before shakespeare.wtf changed hands are recognized as yours as you type them — the Deploy screen offers to hand them back instead of reporting them taken by somebody else

## [9.16.1] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed
- Deploying to a name you already own works again — names you took back in the migration were reported as taken by somebody else, and the Deploy button refused to publish to your own site

## [9.16.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- Take back the sites you published before shakespeare.wtf changed hands — Deploy settings now lists every name that's waiting for you and hands them all back at once, republished under your own key
- Deploys report which relays accepted your site, and can fill in any that missed it without republishing

### Changed
- Deploying to Shakespeare now publishes your site to Nostr under your own key, so it stays readable by any Nostr site viewer with or without shakespeare.wtf
- Recovered sites are titled whatever they call themselves rather than after their web address

### Fixed
- Deploying to Shakespeare works again — it had been reporting success while changing nothing, because the host it uploaded to no longer serves those addresses
- New accounts start with Shakespeare set up as a deployment target instead of an empty screen
- Deployment provider settings now scroll, so Save is always reachable

- Overhauled core shell commands (`cat`, `cp`, `find`, `grep`, `ls`, `sed`, `sort`, and more) for closer POSIX behavior and better ergonomics when AI agents work on your project

- Preview pane grants microphone, ambient-light-sensor, and other device permissions so richer apps can run inside the preview
